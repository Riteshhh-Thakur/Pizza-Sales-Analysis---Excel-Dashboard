## 🚀 Strategic $ Actionable Insights with Recommendations


- **Capitalize on Peak Demand**: Strategically increase marketing presence and ad spend during peak hours (lunch & dinner) and weekends. This will leverage periods of highest organic traffic to maximize immediate      sales volume.
- **Stimulate Off-Peak Demand**: Implement targeted promotions and limited-time offers on slow mid-week days. This will effectively fill operational gaps and stabilize revenue across the entire week.
- **Optimize Product Portfolio for Profitability**: Prioritize the inventory and promotion of large-size pizzas and classic flavors, as they are the primary revenue drivers. Simultaneously, re-evaluate or retire underperforming products (e.g., Brie Carre) to streamline the menu and enhance overall profitability.
- **Increase Average Transaction Value (ATV)**: Design and deploy strategic combo offers and upsell promotions at the point of sale. This will not only increase the average order size but also improve overall revenue per customer without additional marketing spend.

### Conclusion :
Focusing on targeted marketing, product optimization, and upselling can significantly grow revenue and improve customer satisfaction.
